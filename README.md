# Student Performance Predictor

For my Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class, I created 3 machine learning models to try to predict how well students performed based on the 30 predictors in the spreadsheet. Students can either have "low", "normal", or "high" performance, so I used KNN, random forest, and a neural network (softmax with cross-entropy) to try to predict what category students fell into.
